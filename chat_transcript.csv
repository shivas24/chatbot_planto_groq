Current time in India,"India is a large country with a single time zone, known as Indian Standard Time (IST). IST is UTC+5:30.

As I'm a text-based AI model, I don't have real-time access to the current time. However, I can suggest ways for you to find the current time in India:

1. Search for ""current time in India"" on a search engine like Google.
2. Use an online world clock website or app, such as WorldTimeBuddy or TimeAndDate.
3. Check your device's clock or world clock app, which may have India as a pre-set location.

Keep in mind that India does not observe daylight saving time, so the time remains the same throughout the year."
